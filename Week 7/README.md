# Week 6
## Task 1
> 1. Define a class called ComponentBase which includes members like length, width, and corresponding interfaces which can set and output the values.  
> 2. Define a class called Window which virtually inherits from ComponentBase and rewrites its interfaces. Also this class must include a member cost and its corresponding functions which can set and output the value.  
    
**Requirement**: Create a Window instance, and call the set functions and output functions.  
  
## Task 2
> 1. Define a class called A which includes members a,b and corresponding set functions and output functions.
> 2. Define a class called C which virtually inherits from A and embraces extra member d and its corresponding functions which can set and output the value.
> 3. Define a class called E which virtually inherits from A and embraces extra member f and its corresponding functions which can set and output the value.
> 4. Define a class called G which inherits from C and E.
  
**Requirement**: Create a G instance, and call all of the set functions and output functions.
